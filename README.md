### **About the site**

![P2P](client/public/img/p2p.png)

Many small nonprofits receive item donations from donors and distribute those items to people in need. A lot of these nonprofits operate on a shoestring budget and use basic tools such as Microsoft Excel, Word, and Outlook to manage their inventory, interact with donors, and distribute donations to donees. Their inventory, donees, and donor management are at times kept on multiple documents in different locations and managed by various volunteers which makes it difficult to update, maintain, access, and scale.

Our goal is to provide an IT solution that would make the process easier for small nonprofits to manage their donations so that they can spend more time working on their cause -- making a difference.  Our app is called `Parts-to-Purpose`.  It is a simple inventory management platform for nonprofits that will allow them to:
- Update, manage, and track their inventory of donations
- Collect donor and donee information
- Provide donees a portal to login, view and select items needed, add to a cart, and -arrange for pickup/shipment of their cart
- See changes in inventory/stock in near real-time
- Collect and visualize metrics to identify needs and trends so that they can use those metrics to focus donation efforts or community marketing
