We are proud to work with GA BioEd Institute to bring educators across Georgia a way to easily and quickly find specific tools or supplies that are needed for their classroom. Here is something about them in their own words:
                        </p>
                <p>The Georgia BioEd Institute is a division of Georgia Bio, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization serving the state’s life science industry. The Institute’s mission is to strengthen Georgia’s life sciences workforce pipeline through classroom-to-career initiatives that align with industry needs. We are building the capacity of Georgia classrooms to support the future life science workforce with teacher professional development in biotechnology, an equipment depot, a visiting scientist program, and the BioGENEius award for student biotechnology projects. The Institute provides training for current workforce needs (e.g., biotech courses for nonscientists and executive leadership training for future managers), and supports networking and mentoring for early career professionals through the Emerging Leaders Network.
